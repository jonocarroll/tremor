# tremor

<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of tremor is to wrap the [tremor.js][tremor.js] React library as a htmlWidget.

## Installation

You can install the development version of tremor like so:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install.github("jonocarroll/tremor")
```

## Caveats

This didn't end up working. The [example][tremorexample] listed is

``` js
<Card maxWidth="max-w-sm">
    <Text>Sales</Text>
    <Metric>$ 71,465</Metric>
    <Flex marginTop='mt-4'>
        <Text>32% of annual target</Text>
        <Text>$ 225,000</Text>
    </Flex>
    <ProgressBar percentageValue={ 32 } marginTop="mt-2" />
  </Card>
```
![](https://github.com/tremorlabs/tremor/raw/main/images/example.png)

The following _does_ produce output, but none of the rendering seems to happen. 

```{r}
tremor(Text("Sales"), Metric("$ 71,465"))$x$tag
```


The tag appears correct...

```{r}
print(tremor(Text("Sales"), Metric("$ 71,465"))$x$tag)
```

Any suggestions most welcome.

This repo contains probably too many attempts at resolving this, so it is far from minimal.

I have tried:

* including tailwindcss directly
* including tailwindcss via {shiny.tailwind}
* [updating][updatereactR] {reactR} to use ^1.8.0
* yelling at it
* fiddling with it
